# DeepLearning_Road_classification

This projects aims at analysing the quality of roads based on the deep learning framework created by us in Tensorflow. 
The goal of the project was to determine the quality score of a road given an image captured from a drone. This project is done in collaboration with Ericsson research and CMU, Silicon valley. This the practicuum project done in Fall 2016. 

For presentation and overview, please look at file : Presentation_DroneDeepLearning.pdf
For detailed work, experiments, results, methods, architecture : DeepLearning_Practicum_FinalReport.pdf
Final code/network used for experimentation and results : FinalNetwork_13Layers.py 

Other python files were used for intial experimentation and analysis purpose
